Typical Machine **[Whac-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole)**.
consists of a waist-level cabinet with a play area and screen and a large soft black mallet. The five holes in the top of the playing area are filled with small plastic moles that pop out randomly. Points are earned by slamming each mole. The faster the response, the higher the score.

In this case, however, the solution is optimized for hitting moles with fingers. Five holes in the left and five holes in the right part of the playing area are filled with models of holes from which moles accidentally jump out. Points are gained by hitting each mole that is visible. Data is sent to the cloud using PlayFab platform.
